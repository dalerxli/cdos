Title: Coupled dipole approximation of light scattering by clusters of
    nanoparticles
Description: Solves the electromagnetic problem of coupled-dipoles (scattering
    and absorption by a cluster of subwavelength particles in arbitrary 3D
    configuration) by setting up the interaction matrix and solving the linear
    system for multiple incident fields. Functions are provided for linear
    polarisation as well as circular polarisation with full angular averaging
    (optical activity). Retardation is included in the dipole-dipole
    interaction.
